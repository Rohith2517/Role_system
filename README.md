## Interaction

- Initally create a role using Roles button.
- Adding Users: Click on the designated "Add User" button to add a new user.
- Editing Users: Click on "Edit" button to modify data.
- Deleting Users: Click the corresponding "Delete" button to permanently remove a user.
- Role Management: When adding or editing a user, you can assign a specific role. This helps to control the access and permissions for each user.
- LocalStorage Utilization: The application leverages the browser's localStorage for user data persistence. This entails:
    - Saving user and role data modifications (addition, editing, deletion) locally to your browser.
    - Maintaining user and role data even upon page refreshes, as it's retrieved from localStorage upon subsequent loads.
