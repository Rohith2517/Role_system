# Role Management System

## Project Overview

The Role Management System is a React-based application designed to manage users and roles. It allows administrators to create, update, delete, and assign roles to users seamlessly. The interface is user-friendly, making it easy to manage permissions and maintain organizational hierarchy.

## Features

- **Role Management**: Add, edit, delete, and view roles with predefined permissions.
- **User Management**: Assign roles to users and manage their details.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Reflect changes in roles and users instantly (requires page refresh in current implementation).
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive and optimized for different screen sizes.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- Netlify CLI (optional, for hosting on Netlify)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rohith2517/Role_system.git
    cd Role_system
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the Development Server**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   The application will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

4. **Build for Production**

    To create a production-ready build, run:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

   This generates a `build/` folder that can be deployed.

## Hosting Instructions

### Deploying on Netlify

1. Build the project:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2. Drag and drop the `build/` folder into your Netlify dashboard, or use the Netlify CLI:

    ```bash
    netlify deploy --prod
    ```

### Hosting on GitHub Pages (Optional)

1. Install the GitHub Pages package:

    ```bash
    npm install gh-pages --save-dev
    ```

2. Add the following to your `package.json`:

    ```json
    "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/Role_system",
    "scripts": {
      "predeploy": "npm run build",
      "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
    }
    ```

3. Deploy using:

    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains all source files.
- `components/`: Includes reusable UI components like `RoleTable`, `UserTable`, and `RoleForm`.
- `App.js`: The main application file.
- `public/`: Contains static assets.
- `build/`: Generated after running `npm run build`, used for deployment.

## Features Explanation

### Role Management:
- Add roles with predefined permissions (e.g., Read, Write, Delete).
- Edit or delete roles dynamically.

### User Management:
- Assign roles to users from a dropdown list.
- Users can be updated or removed.

### UI & Navigation:
- The application features a responsive navigation bar with a Dashboard title and buttons for navigating between Role Management and User Management sections.

## Notes

### Dynamic Updates:
Currently, changes to roles are visible only after refreshing the page.  
To implement real-time updates, you can use React Context or a state management library like Redux.

### Future Improvements:
- Add backend integration for persistent data storage.
- Implement role-based access control for users.
